## :star: About me

ðŸ’¬ My name is Damian Lagua and I'm a Full Stack Engineer.

ðŸŒ± I'm an IT enthusiast and English studies graduate which also happen to be my passion and hobby among many others which may include skiing and linguistics. 

ðŸ¤” I consider myself meticulous and purposeful person on a self-development journey prepared to face lots of challenges. On my journey I've already encountered many ups and downs but those downs motivate me the most.
As an IT enthusiast, I thrive on challenges and am on a continuous journey of self-development. My meticulous nature and curiosity drive me to delve deep into subjects, ensuring a thorough understanding.

ðŸš€ I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute meaningfully to the world of technology. Whether it's through refining existing projects or diving into new ones, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions and constant improvement.
