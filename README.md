# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## :star: About me

ðŸ’¬ My name is Damian Skwierawski and I'm a Full Stack Engineer.

ðŸŒ± I'm an IT enthusiast and English studies graduate which also happen to be my passion and hobby among many others which may include skiing and linguistics. 

ðŸ¤” I consider myself meticulous and purposeful person on a self-development journey prepared to face lots of challenges. On my journey I've already encountered many ups and downs but those downs motivate me the most.
One of my personality traits is also curiosity and I like to do background research on many matters to get to the bottom of it so I can understand it fully.

ðŸ”­ In my repository you can find some project that I've been working on.
